Project In Progress

📘 README.md – Data Engineering ETL Pipeline (CSV / JSON / XML → PostgreSQL)

📌 Overview

This repository contains a complete ETL (Extract – Transform – Load) pipeline built in Python, designed for junior Data Engineers who want to demonstrate essential data ingestion and database loading skills.

The project extracts structured and semi-structured data from CSV, JSON, and XML files, transforms it into a unified format, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy and psycopg2.

This repository reflects a real-world data ingestion scenario and shows practical knowledge of:

processing heterogeneous data sources

cleaning and transforming datasets

handling missing & inconsistent values

building modular ETL functions

loading structured data into Postgres

📑 Logging System

This ETL pipeline includes a simple but effective log file system that tracks every major step of the workflow. Logging is essential for Data Engineering, as it provides transparency, debugging information, and traceability for every run of the pipeline.
This function:

adds a timestamp

appends human-readable messages

tracks the start and end of each ETL phase
